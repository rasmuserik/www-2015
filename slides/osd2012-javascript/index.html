<h2>Intro</h2><pre>
Serious JavaScript
this presentation consist of two parts
first we'll set the baseline and look at
what is javascript
from a computer science and programming language perspective.
and what is it that makes it such an interesting language

then the seocnd part explores the aproach to developing serious javascript applications,
best practices.

</pre><h2>What?</h2><pre>
but first what is javascript

if we were to describe javascript in a single sentence, htat could be

ubiquitous somewhat functional scripting language with quirks and good performance

ubiquitous that means that is is everywhere

</pre><h3>Ubiquitous</h3><pre>
javascript is the most easily deployed language for mobile applications

it is also the language that are on most webbrowsers
and it is a language that is often used to script as an interenal scripting language in applications

as well as scripting language in servers and even in some embedded systems
it is the most ubiquitous language for end user applications because it is everywhere.

</pre><h3>Somewhat Functional</h3><pre>
javascript is also a somewhat functional language

I like functional programming, it is very expressive

functions in javascript is first class language
which means that you can pass them around and use higher order functions

it is also possible to define ananyumouns founcions

and javascript ahs gotten closures right

this is a lot better than a lot of the mainstream
it is actually rare in mainstream languages that they got functions and closures correct

still it is only a somewhat functional language

does not have tail call optimisation
and it data structures are mostly mutable

it does not have a natural immutable data structure for list processing
which is usually used a lot in functional programming

</pre><h3>Scripting Language</h3><pre>
javascript is a scripting language
it has regular expressions and string processing integrated in the language
as well as hashmap s, which is called objects in javascipt, as a natural part of the language, datastructure

as a scripting language it is also dynamicly type
this implies that it is very quick to prototype things in it
but at the same time you loose a lot of safety

errors may be caught at runtime instead of compile time , if they are called at all,
and as an dynamic language it is much less toolable

you can get less help from the developmnent environment

or it is more difficult for the development environment to integrate with the language

</pre><h3>Quirky</h3><pre>
javascript also has a lot of quirks, it was designed and implemente very quickly

there are some severe semantic issues

so if you are going to do serious javascript development
you really have to learn 


</pre><h3>Good performance</h3><pre>
javascript is also very interesting because its virtual machines
has very good performance.
a couple of years ago the webbrowsers started to compete on javascript on performance
and implmentations of javascript engines

I would venture to say that the javascript implementations tha


</pre><h3>Transition</h3><pre>
so that was a bit about what javascript is
and and what's so interesting about it

next how do we approach serious javascript development

</pre><h2>How?</h2><pre>
        So, how can we approach serious javascript development.

        first we write the tests for our code,
        then we document what it is to do,
        then we write the code with style
        and finally we package it for distribution

</pre><h3>Testing</h3><pre>
        Javascript is a dynamic language
        and that makes testing even more important

        We can look at test on different levels.

        There is the unit testing, or internal testing,
        which is written within the program.
        There are many frameworks for this,
        of which Jasmine seems to be
        the most popular one.
        (We are using that,
        or sometimes just write the tests frameworkless).

        On a higher level there is system testing.
        JavaScript often use web technology
        for user interfaces,
        and there are several tools 
        for automating web application testing.
        Selenium is a good bet,
        as it remote controls 
        most of the different browsers,
        and also has GUI for test development
        which means it can be done by non-developer-testers.


</pre><h3>Documentating</h3><pre>
        When documenting, we both
        write general project documentation,
        and also within the code

        In javascript there are several approaches
        to documenting api's, 
        but the most promising seems to be jsdoc.
        it is similar to javadoc or doxygen,
        but has added the option
        to add type annotations
        which may later be used
        for some static type checking of the code

        As a supplement to this
        literate programming 
        is beginning to be popular
        in the javascript community

        Essentially we write the code 
        as if it were to be read
        my programmers as well as machines.

        docco is a nice tool for this
        which extracts documentation
        written in markdown
        and format it in
        two nicely formatted columns
        one with the docs
        and another with the code
        nicely aligned with eachother.

</pre><h3>Code Style</h3><pre>
</pre><h3>Packaging</h3><pre>
</pre><h2>Outro</h2><pre>
        Questions, catch me later.

# Presentation

Serious JavaScript

This talk consists of two parts.

First we'll set the baseline
and look at: what is JavaScript

from a computer science 
programming language perspective

and also
why is it interesting
and should be take seriously


Then the second part is about
how to approach
serious javascript development
and best practices


- so What is JavaScript?

## Slide 1

If we should define it in a single sentence,
it could be:

an ubiquitous 
somewhat functional 
asynchronous 
dynamic 
scripting language 
with prototypal object model 
and quirks. 


Ubiquitous
- it is everywhere.

That is also what 
makes JavaScript
so interesting.

JavaScript is the most easily deployed language
for applications on mobile phones

and it is also the language
that is in most webbrowsers.

tons of different applications
has it embedded for scripting

an JavaScript also runs very well for servers

and even in some embedded systems.


-----

somewhat functional
i like functional programming a lot
it's very expressive

functions in jsvascript are first class values
that means you can pass them around and
use higher order functions.
They can even be defined anonymously
and javascript got closures correct
that is a lot better than most mainstream languages

it is only somewhat functional
because it is missing tail recursion

and mosts of javascript datastructures are mutable

it doesn't have a natural datastructure
for immutable lists
which are usually used in functional programming


--------

Asynchronous,
a lot of the engines
does not support
multiple threads

This is not as big an issue
as you might expect.

A lot of the libraries are asynchronous
so when you are reading a file, waiting for a timeout,
or writing to the network,
the execution is not blocked,
but instead you just
pass a callback
to the readfile or timeout function.
And this will then be called when the desired action has finished.

This actually performes well
as long as the application
is not cpu-bound.

Cpu-heavy applications
must yield to stay responsive,
but on the other hand
we are released from locks.



Dynamic means that 
types are resolved at runtime.

This means less toolability,
and that errors are not caught at compiletime.
This is a trade-off against stability 
for rapid prototyping.



Scripting language

regular expressions are a part of the language
and hashmap is the usual datastructure



prototypal inheritance


--------

one of the quirks of javascript is that tha language don't have builtin support for modules

fortunately recently a lot of the implementors 
found common ground, for how to define and load modules.
especially for application scripting and server side

In a commonjs modules, symbols can be exported
by assigning them as properties
on the special exports object.
Similarly modules can be loaded
via the require function
that returns the desired module as an object.

Unfortunately this doesn't work in browsers
The require function blocks,
and module loading in browsers must be asynchronous.
The approach here instead is asynchrounus module definition
which essentially wraps commonjs modules in a closure.


For this, there are tools like
requirejs, enderjs and browserify.

In the future there will be harmony.
Harmony is the next version of JavaScript
and it contains syntax for modules.
It is even possible to experiment with it now
as Traceour recently has been released.
It is an open source tool for compiling JavaScript from the future to now.
